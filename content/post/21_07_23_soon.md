Just a small update to let you know the Rimworld Multiplayer Team is hard at work making 1.3 and Ideology compatible with the mod.

# Notes

1.3 and Ideology released a couple of days ago and we've been hard at work making it compatible. Currently the mod is undergoing closed-alpha testing by a few individuals to iron out common bugs and give developers feedback.

1.3 is our priority but after it's stable and officially released to the public we will work focus on Ideology.

Zetrith has also pushed his old work to GitHub meaning we have a large number of performance enhancements and code refactoring that will be present in 1.3. It's likely that these features will also be backported to a final 1.2 release.

Thanks to all our developers and testers for their hard work.

Cheers.
