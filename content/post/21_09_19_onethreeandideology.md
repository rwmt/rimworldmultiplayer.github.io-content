Multiplayer has been updated to RimWorld 1.3 and the Ideology expansion by yours truly and the rest of the team.

<!--more-->

Apart from supporting the base game features, with this update I took my time to fix Multiplayer's long-standing bugs and make some much-needed general improvements.
The highlights of this release:
- The mod mismatch screen has been refreshed
- There's a new mod compatibility window
- Improvements to the saving system
- Desync stack tracing is now enabled by default and no longer marked experimental. The performance impact has been minimized.
- Pausing dialogs (trading etc.) no longer block access to the map

A fuller changelog:
- Updated to RimWorld 1.3 and Ideology (the only major feature not currently supported is the archonexus ending)
- Pausing dialogs (trading etc.) no longer block access to the map
- Mod mismatch screen has been refreshed
- Ping other players on maps and the planet (Numpad 0 or Mouse 4 to ping, Mouse 5 or click alert to jump to pings)
- New mod compatibility window, compatibility scores are now part of this window
- Desync stack tracing is now enabled by default and no longer marked experimental. The performance impact has been minimized.
- Desync info files are now smaller and more useful (they now contain host's traces and no longer include save files)
- The game now waits until everyone is done saving
- Autosaves are much faster (they no longer are full saves)
- Autosave interval units: toggle between ingame days and realtime minutes
- Any player can create a local full save now
- Join points: created by host with /joinpoint, previously sometimes called full saves and done with /autosave
- Auto join points hosting option: On join, On desync, On autosave
- The "Try resync" button when desynced now rejoins instead of resimulating
- Choose who can use dev mode: Host only, Everyone
- God mode is now per player
- Ransom demand events now work in multiplayer
- Option to randomly suffix your username when joining a server and your name is taken
- Added a notice when there are loading errors
- Fix choice letters desyncing (wanderer joins etc.)
- Fix the game sometimes freezing
- Fix id errors after converting to singleplayer
- Fix Royalty monument blueprint placing
- Fix Royalty title renouncing

User testimonials range from reporting incredible stability to desyncing every few minutes. The betas have been in development for some time now and I myself can vouch for the former but it's impossible to test across the vast array of setups y'all might have. Please make your issue reports detailed and have patience as we work on making things even more stable.
